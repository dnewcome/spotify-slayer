# Spotify Slayer — Plan

## Current State

Working Next.js app with Spotify OAuth. Users can browse playlists, view tracks, and build DJ sets stored in localStorage. Auth, playlist browsing, track listing, set CRUD, and drag-and-drop reordering are fully functional.

### Existing files
- `src/lib/types.ts` — `DJSet`, `DJSetTrack`
- `src/lib/sets.ts` — localStorage CRUD for sets, `spotifyTrackToDJSetTrack`, duration helpers
- `src/lib/spotify.ts` — Spotify API wrapper, `SpotifyTrack`, `SpotifyPlaylist` types
- `src/lib/auth.ts` — NextAuth config
- `src/app/sets/[id]/page.tsx` — set builder with dnd-kit drag-and-drop
- `src/app/sets/page.tsx` — set list management
- `src/app/playlists/[id]/PlaylistDetail.tsx` — playlist view with "Add to set" button
- `src/components/AddToSetModal.tsx` — modal to pick which set to add a track to
- `src/components/TrackRow.tsx` — reusable track row component

---

## Spotify API Notes (February 2026 Breaking Changes)

- `/v1/playlists/{id}/tracks` → deprecated, use `/v1/playlists/{id}/items`
- Playlist item objects now use key `item` instead of `track`
- Simplified playlist objects from `/me/playlists` now use `items: { total }` instead of `tracks: { total }`
- Audio features endpoint (BPM, key, energy) — deprecated, no replacement via Web API
- Recommendations endpoint — deprecated
- `localhost` redirect URIs rejected as "Insecure" — must use `http://127.0.0.1`

## Core Workflow This App Solves

The user's DJ prep workflow today:
1. Browse Spotify artist radio / channels to discover tracks
2. Try to add to a playlist — Spotify's UI defaults to "Liked Songs", wrong destination frequently
3. After discovery, manually hunt each track on Soulseek to acquire the file
4. No way to track energy level, role, or genre per track
5. No structured way to build set arc (warm up → build → peak → come down)

This app owns all five of those steps.

---

## Feature Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Active Set Builder ✓ (mostly done)
- Set list management (create, rename, delete) ✓
- Add tracks from playlists via modal ✓
- Drag-and-drop reorder ✓
- Total duration display ✓
- Import / export set as JSON (todo)
- Export as Spotify playlist (todo — API already wired)
- Export as plain text tracklist (todo)

### Phase 2 — Track Library, Metadata & Visualization (next)

See detailed implementation plan below.

### Phase 3 — Set Structure & Arc

Sets have named sections with target energy ranges. Tracks slot into sections.

```ts
interface DJSetSection {
  id: string;
  name: string;               // "Warm Up", "Build", "Peak Hour", "Come Down"
  targetEnergyMin: number;
  targetEnergyMax: number;
  tracks: SetTrackSlot[];
}
```

- Drag tracks between sections
- Set arc visualization warns if a track's energy doesn't fit its section's target range

### Phase 4 — Track Suggestions from Own Library

Since Spotify's recommendations API is deprecated, suggestions come from the user's own
tagged library. The more tracks tagged, the more useful this becomes.

- "Suggest tracks for this section" — filter library by section's target energy + genre
- "What else sounds like this?" — tracks with matching tags + similar energy
- Recently used tracks surfaced when building a new set in the same genre

### Phase 5 — Acquisition Workflow (Soulseek)

The bridge between "I want this track" (Spotify discovery) and "I have this file" (local).

- Acquisition queue view: all tracks across all sets with `acquisitionStatus: "want"`
- One-click open Soulseek search pre-filled with artist + title
  - Nicotine+ supports a `nicotine://` URL scheme or CLI trigger
  - Fallback: copy "Artist - Title" to clipboard
- Mark as acquired, optionally paste in local file path
- Export "need to find" list as text file for batch Soulseek sessions
- Longer term: sidecar local process (slskd/Nicotine+ headless) exposing a REST API on
  localhost; Next.js routes call it to search and trigger downloads in-app

---

## Phase 2 — Detailed Implementation Plan

### 2a. Track metadata library (localStorage)

A separate localStorage store keyed by Spotify track ID. Metadata persists across sets —
tag a track once, it carries those tags everywhere.

**New file: `src/lib/library.ts`**
```ts
const LIBRARY_KEY = "track_library";
type Library = Record<string, TrackMetadata>;

export function getTrackMeta(id: string): TrackMetadata | undefined
export function setTrackMeta(id: string, patch: Partial<TrackMetadata>): void
export function getAllTrackMeta(): Library
```

**New type in `src/lib/types.ts`: `TrackMetadata`**
```ts
export interface TrackMetadata {
  spotifyId: string;
  isrc?: string;       // from Spotify external_ids.isrc — key for MusicBrainz lookup
  mbid?: string;       // MusicBrainz recording ID, populated after enrichment
  energyLevel?: number;   // 1–5: 1=ambient/sparse, 5=peak/banger
  busyness?: number;      // 1–5: 1=minimal, 5=dense/complex
  tags?: string[];        // freeform: "floor filler", "transition", "opener", "vocal", etc.
  genre?: string[];       // seeded from MusicBrainz, user can override
  bpm?: number;           // from BPM detection service or Beatport
  key?: string;           // musical key
  acquisitionStatus?: "want" | "acquired" | "skip";
  localPath?: string;     // path to local file once acquired
  notes?: string;
  mbEnriched?: boolean;   // true once MusicBrainz enrichment has been attempted
}
```

**Energy scale:**
- 1 — Ambient / sparse / intro
- 2 — Warm, low-key
- 3 — Mid-energy, flowing
- 4 — High energy, building
- 5 — Peak / floor filler / banger

**Busyness scale:**
- 1 — Minimal, lots of space
- 2 — Light elements
- 3 — Moderate density
- 4 — Busy, many layers
- 5 — Dense / complex

**Update `DJSetTrack` in `src/lib/types.ts`** — add `isrc?` field so we can do
MusicBrainz lookups later without re-fetching from Spotify:
```ts
export interface DJSetTrack {
  // ...existing fields...
  isrc?: string;
}
```

**Update `SpotifyTrack` in `src/lib/spotify.ts`** — add `external_ids`:
```ts
export interface SpotifyTrack {
  // ...existing fields...
  external_ids?: { isrc?: string };
}
```

**Update `spotifyTrackToDJSetTrack` in `src/lib/sets.ts`** — capture ISRC:
```ts
export function spotifyTrackToDJSetTrack(track: SpotifyTrack): DJSetTrack {
  return {
    ...existing,
    isrc: track.external_ids?.isrc,
  };
}
```

---

### 2b. Energy + busyness tagging UI in set builder

**Location:** `src/app/sets/[id]/page.tsx`

The set builder loads all track metadata once on mount:
```ts
const [library, setLibrary] = useState<Record<string, TrackMetadata>>({});
useEffect(() => { setLibrary(getAllTrackMeta()); }, [set?.id]);
```

`handleMetaChange` updates library and local state:
```ts
function handleMetaChange(trackId: string, patch: Partial<TrackMetadata>) {
  setTrackMeta(trackId, patch);
  setLibrary(getAllTrackMeta());
}
```

**`SortableTrackRow`** receives `metadata` and `onMetaChange` as props. Each row shows:
- 4px colored left stripe (energy + busyness → HSL color, gray if untagged)
- 5-dot energy selector (always visible, click to set level)
- 5-dot busyness selector
- Genre tags as small pills (when available from MusicBrainz)

**Color function:**
```ts
function trackColor(energy: number, busyness: number): string {
  const hue = 220 - (energy - 1) * 55;  // 220=blue → 0=red
  const sat = 50 + (busyness - 1) * 12;
  const light = 35 + (busyness - 1) * 7;
  return `hsl(${hue}, ${sat}%, ${light}%)`;
}
```

Color map:
- energy=1, busyness=1 → dark blue (ambient)
- energy=3, busyness=3 → green (mid)
- energy=5, busyness=5 → bright red (peak)
- untagged → zinc-700 gray

**`DotSelector` component** (inline, no modal):
- 5 small clickable squares (12px each, 2px gap, ~70px total)
- Filled up to current value, empty above
- Click sets level, click active level resets to undefined (toggle off)

---

### 2c. Set arc visualization

**`SetArcBar` component** — horizontal color strip at top of set builder:
- Each track is a colored block proportional to `durationMs / totalDuration`
- Color from `trackColor(energyLevel, busyness)` or gray if untagged
- Tooltip on hover showing track name + energy + busyness values
- Shows after the set name/stats header
- Only renders when set has tracks

This gives the "energy arc over time" view at a glance. A warm-up set should show blue
blocks shifting to green/yellow/red at peak and coming back down.

**Per-row left stripe:**
- 4px wide `div` with `alignSelf: stretch`, `borderRadius: 2px`
- Background color from `trackColor` or `#3f3f46` if untagged
- Lives between the drag handle and track number in the row layout

---

### 2d. MusicBrainz enrichment

**Why MusicBrainz over Discogs or Last.fm:**
- No API key required (just a `User-Agent` header)
- Oriented toward digital library organization (not physical media like Discogs)
- ISRC lookup — most reliable cross-source identifier
- Recording relationships — same recording across different releases (useful for
  matching Spotify tracks to Soulseek results)
- Completely free at personal-tool scale

**ISRC as the linking key:**
Spotify exposes ISRC on every track via `external_ids.isrc`. MusicBrainz can look up
recordings directly by ISRC. This is more reliable than fuzzy artist+title matching.

```
Spotify track
  └── external_ids.isrc → "USRC17607839"
        └── GET /ws/2/isrc/{isrc}?fmt=json&inc=recordings
              └── recording MBID
                    └── GET /ws/2/recording/{mbid}?fmt=json&inc=genres+tags
                          └── genre list, tag list → stored in TrackMetadata
```

**New file: `src/app/api/enrich/route.ts`**

```ts
// POST { isrc: string, spotifyId: string }
// Returns { mbid, genres, tags } or { error }
//
// MusicBrainz rate limit: 1 req/sec for unauthenticated.
// Required header: User-Agent: SpotifySlayer/1.0 (contact@email.com)
//
// Step 1: GET https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/isrc/{isrc}?fmt=json&inc=recordings
// Step 2: GET https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/recording/{mbid}?fmt=json&inc=genres+tags
// Return genres (curated, smaller) + high-vote tags (count > 1, noisier but more granular)
```

**Genre data from MusicBrainz:**
- `genres` — curated list (more reliable, smaller set)
- `tags` — folksonomy (noisier, more granular sub-genre detail)
- Strategy: use `genres` as canonical list, supplement with tags having `count > 1`

**Enrichment trigger in set builder:**
- On set load, find tracks with `isrc` but no `mbEnriched` in their metadata
- Enrich them sequentially with 1100ms delay between requests (respects rate limit)
- Show subtle loading indicator per track while enriching
- On success: update metadata in library, set `mbEnriched: true`, show genre pills on row
- On failure (no ISRC match): set `mbEnriched: true` anyway to prevent retrying

**Note:** Enrichment is background, non-blocking. User can tag energy/busyness immediately
without waiting for MusicBrainz.

## Track Sources

### Spotify (current)
- Browse playlists ✓
- Playlist track detail ✓
- Search (wired in lib, UI todo)
- Recently played (wired in lib, UI todo)
- Artist top tracks / discography (future — replaces deprecated radio/recommendations)

### MusicBrainz (Phase 2 — metadata enrichment only, not discovery)
- ISRC → genre/tags
- Cross-source recording identity (MBID links to Beatport, Discogs, etc.)

### Soulseek (Phase 5 — acquisition)
- Manual workflow support first (pre-filled search links), sidecar automation later

### Beatport (future — metadata + acquisition)
- Requires partner API application
- Best source for BPM, key, and precise electronic music genre/label data
- Beatport track IDs linkable via MusicBrainz URL relationships

### BPM Detection Service (separate project)
- Local service that analyzes audio files and returns BPM + key
- App calls it via localhost REST endpoint
- Populates `bpm` and `key` fields in TrackMetadata for acquired tracks

---

## Common Track Interface (future — when multiple sources are active)

```ts
interface Track {
  id: string;
  source: "spotify" | "soulseek" | "beatport" | "local";
  name: string;
  artists: string[];
  album?: string;
  durationMs: number;
  imageUrl?: string;
  spotifyUri?: string;
  spotifyId?: string;
  isrc?: string;
  mbid?: string;
  beatportId?: string;
  bpm?: number;
  key?: string;
  genre?: string[];
  energyLevel?: number;
  busyness?: number;
  tags?: string[];
  acquisitionStatus?: "want" | "acquired" | "skip";
  localPath?: string;
}
```

## Architecture Notes

- **Frontend + API routes:** Next.js (current)
- **Storage v1:** localStorage — sets, track library, metadata. No server DB needed until
  multi-device sync is wanted.
- **Storage v2 (future):** SQLite via a local API, or lightweight cloud DB if sync matters
- **MusicBrainz calls:** proxied through Next.js API routes (server-side, avoids CORS,
  rate-limited in one place)
- **Soulseek sidecar:** separate local process, called via localhost from Next.js API routes
- **BPM detection service:** separate project, same localhost pattern
- **Beatport OAuth:** handled via Next.js API routes when added, similar to Spotify auth
- No external services beyond Spotify OAuth needed for v1 or v2

---

## Dev Notes

- Dev server: `node node_modules/next/dist/bin/next dev --webpack` (SWC arm64 binary corrupted)
- Must access via `http://127.0.0.1:3000` (Spotify rejects `localhost` as "Insecure")
- `allowedDevOrigins: ["127.0.0.1"]` in `next.config.ts` required for HMR on 127.0.0.1
- `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000` in `.env`
- `getServerSession()` must receive `authOptions` argument or always returns null
